    <h1>1960s</h1>
    <h3>1963</h3>
    <h5>J.C.R. Licklider, a director at the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), is studying systems to support military “command and control.” Addressing a memo to “Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network,” he describes a time-sharing network with standard languages that researchers can use to access data and programs from different computers.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section3">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1969</h3>

    </div>

    <div id="section4">
    <h1>1970s</h1>
    <h3>1972</h3>
    <h5>Electrical engineer Robert Kahn gives the first public demonstration of the ARPANET at the International Computer Communication Conference, featuring terminals that can access computers located across the country. Email is integrated into the network’s File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the standard for transferring files between computers.</h5>

    <div id="section8">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1988</h3>
    <h5>A Cornell researcher’s network malware — the first computer worm — shows the inherent vulnerability of the internet. Cybersecurity becomes a major concern as global data grows rapidly and companies storing sensitive and confidential information are routinely targeted.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section9">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1989</h3>
    <h5>America Online (AOL), CompuServe, and Prodigy begin to emerge as the Big Three online service providers. They introduce millions of users to dial-up messaging, email, and web portals over the coming years, but try to confine them within proprietary, closed platforms.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section10">
    <h1>1990s</h1>
    <h3>1990</h3>
    <h5>Tim Berners-Lee develops a prototype for the World Wide Web, an application layer running on top of the internet that’s based on hypertext. The result is a system for accessing resources online using Uniform Resource Locators (web address URLs), the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and HyperText Markup Language (HTML), making the internet more accessible for users and application developers.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section11">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1993</h3>
    <h5>CERN officially puts the World Wide Web in the public domain. The Mosaic web browser, created at the National Center for Supercomputing at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, is the first web browser to display images next to text, letting users easily navigate between web pages.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section12">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1995</h3>
    <h5>The consumer web takes shape as the digital land grab begins. Amazon, Yahoo, and eBay launch. Microsoft introduces Internet Explorer, sparking the first browser war. One outcome of the competition for browser dominance is Netscape’s development of JavaScript, a programming language that runs in browsers to display dynamic content, making interactive web pages possible.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section13">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1996</h3>
    <h5>The US Congress passes the Communications Decency Act to regulate indecency and obscenity online. The act includes Section 230, which protects “interactive computer services” from being treated as the publisher of third-party content and grants immunity from civil liability if the services make a good faith effort to restrict prohibited material.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section14">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1997</h3>
    <h5>The phrase “the Great Firewall of China” first appears in a Wired article in reference to the Chinese government’s desire to control internet access. Beijing implements various restrictive laws and technologies over the coming years to impose digital censorship within its borders, establishing a model for other national governments to claim sovereignty over the internet and attempt to limit the flow of information.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section15">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1998</h3>
    <h5>Google is founded, innovating the business of search and clicks.</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section16">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>1999</h3>

    <div id="section17">
    <h1>2000s</h1>
    <h3>2000</h3>

    </div>

    <div id="section18">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>2001</h3>
    <h5>BitTorrent, a decentralized communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing, is released. The open-source technology enables users to download large files from multiple hosts at once rather than from a single server, but the tech is also used to pirate content.</h5>

    <div id="section19">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>2004</h3>
    <h5>Facebook is created, signaling a new era of social media on the internet. Within a decade, the company will go public and begin aggressively monetizing users, becoming an advertising behemoth to rival Google.</h5>

    </div>

    <div id="section24">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>2013</h3>

    <div id="section25">
    <h1><br></h1>

    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3>Here’s an creepy conspiracy theory.</h3>
    <h5>In between the anti-vaccine and flat Earth diatriabes, conspiracy theorists occasionally come up with interesting and provocative ideas. A good example of a recent one is the “Dead Internet Theory.”</h5>
    </div>

    <div id="section29">
    <h1><br></h1>
    <h3><br></h3>
    <h5>This theory states that the Internet as we know it actually died sometime between 2016 and 2017, according to The Atlantic. However, this doesn’t mean that the Internet is gone necessarily. Rather, most of the “people” we see online doing things like publishing content, posting social media updates, and commenting are actually bots. </h5>
